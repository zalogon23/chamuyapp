[34m|[m * [33mf199a86[m Fixed /messages/:id MessageSender problem distinguishing self and other messages.
[34m|[m * [33mbc388e0[m The MessageSender COMPONENT is aware of 'from' and 'to' users' ids. Just need a query to send the message.

And moddified /messages/:id to check if the messagesContext is loaded before checking for the messages and existence of the conversation. If there is a conversation (even with no messages), stays.

* [35m|[m [33m52decbe[m On /messages/:id it shows a spinner whil checking for messages and after that redirects or show the content (currently only a placeholder).
[35m|[m[35m/[m  
* [33m285b8f9[m Added /messages/:id PAGE. Redirects if you arent logged in, or there are no messages.
* [33mcbbcc63[m Removed Messages LOIC from /messages PAGE to messagesContext. So it is easier to use between pages.
* [33mabf756a[m Now the bubble and the message slide redirects you to /messages/:id (this id is the Match TABLE row ID).
* [33m6053614[m Modified /messages PAGE to dont show open conversations on the bubble slider. And only show the ones with no messages. And on the bottom theres a MessagesDisplay to show the last message sent. Modified getMatches QUERY to ask for the content os each match too.
* [33m79847ef[m Added /messages link on Header.
* [33mfbea581[m Added /messages PAGE. It has Bubble COMPONENT for diplaying match image and link to its chat with the current logged user. Also there's a BubbleSlider COMPONENT, that handles the sliding process. And the overflow.
* [33mf426484[m Added QUERY to ask for a certain user's matches. Only argument userID.
* [33m7da90eb[m Modified showingUsers CONTEXT so it doesnt fetch again when there is a change on session, but instead when ther's a change on user id (and only fetches if there is a value on user.id). And improved ImagesPicker, so it updates immeadiaely not only when you add or remove images, buttoo when you remove all the images (cause that case was not working).
* [33m2e10654[m Modified ImagesPicker to not realize graphql calls for uploading images when there are no images to upload (obvious, but it wasnt conditioned). And avoid even to update the images field if there are no changes at all.
* [33m27b41f0[m Modified /profile PAGE to update tab to View Mode when you click on Update after changing the images.
* [33m203cfb3[m Fixed redirect error on /profile, /login, /register PAGES. It didnt redirected because it was checking isLoggedIn/Out, but running when there were changes on 'session'...
* [33m27ee31a[m Modified HNavBar and VNavBar to redirect you automatically to /login PAGE after you click on the Logout Button.
* [33m0075231[m Modified showingUsers CONTEXT 'useEffect' so it checks if there's any user on the list. If there is, and the user logged out, then the list is set to an empty array.
* [33m6e30e0d[m When you reached the last user, the showingContext searches for more users. If it receaves something back, it updates the lsit and goes back to index 0, if not, it stays in the last user. There is a votedUsers dynamic list, that adds the votedUser ID, so if the client keeps pressing the like/dislike button, it wont be shooting api calls.
* [33mca30b29[m showingUsers CONTEXT now has like and dislike functions which vote the current user, with a like 'true/false'. And that user is never shown again. The only thing left is to look for new users when there are no more.
* [33m085e760[m Setted showingUsers CONTEXT to show actual users. Depending on the logged in user.
* [33mc124a1d[m Modified ImagesPicker so when you update your images it doesnt reload but instead. When receives data back it updates the context USER. So it is always up-to-date.
* [33me8cc9e3[m Improved ImagesPicker so now the uploadedImages are global to the children components. So the order is always linear. There's no more Input per ImageAdder, instead one is created on the fly when clicked on add button. The only caviat is hat when the user uploads two or more images with the same name, the ImagesPicker removes always the more earlier one (At least, now, it doesnt remove them all haha).
* [33mf453a0a[m ImagePicker style improvement.
* [33maab97a7[m Modified ImagesSlider to have a semi-fixed height in all of its images.
* [33m35e534b[m Added Tabs to the /profile PAGE, so it switches between ImagesSlider and ImagesPicker. And it is tabbeable. But ari-labels are left*
* [33m4971817[m Removed some ImageUpdate try's code.
* [33m51a725c[m Added updateUserImages QUERY. And connected it with ImagesPicker COMPONENT. Plus, some UI modifications. The page reloads when you press the update images button and they end uploading.
* [33m4203ce4[m Removed ID from uploadImages MUTATION (because it isnt needed). On the other hand we need to add a query to update the user 'images'. And here we need the ID and the images string. The ImagesPicker has to kind of children. The received images display as images (that can be removed). And the ImageAdds which are empty and can be fulfillef with a file. When a received image is removed all the ImageAdds move 1 place back, conservinf FILE. The ImageAdd also has the possibility to be removed.
* [33mb46745f[m Created ImagesPicker COMPONENT. With user images, you can delte them by clicking the cross.
* [33m2a44fe5[m Tweaked sendFiles query to send an ID too. So the BACKEND knows which user to update his/her images FIELD.
* [33m6b9c52b[m Tweaked the sendFile QUERY to sendFiles. And allowed multiple files on /profile INPUT (provisional).
* [33m194052f[m Added apollo-client-upload. Added a query for sending a file. And provisionally putted an input file on /profile PAGE.
* [33maa16caf[m Modified HNavBar and VNavBar to set signOut({redirect: false}). So it doesnt redirect toughly. Instead the /profile PAGE or wherever you are, is aware of your sign out state because of the User Context and decides what to do according to that.
* [33m5eed194[m Replaced all window.location.replace with Router.replace, so it can still use the NextJS SPA behaviour.
* [33m7280a41[m Created user CONTEXT, so instead of re-writing the useSession hook over and over again, there is a global state.
* [33me4c69df[m When signing in through custom provider (email/password) there's no more redirect on wrong match. Instead both fields get red. Only when you login succesfully then you pass to /profile PAGE
* [33m44252d8[m Modified README.md file (for better documentation)
* [33m7111a35[m Modified Log Out button to be displayed correctly on mobile and desktop. And modifies /login PAGE to automatically use GitHub login process when clicking the button (instead of sending you to the Next Auth Providers PAGE).
* [33me9c9c4a[m Fixed tabbing problem while switching from Input to Edit button and viceversa
* [33m16d9998[m Added Log Out button on Header COMPONENT.
* [33mef741ff[m EditableDescription modification
* [33m0242d36[m Added Gender and Age data to /profile PAGE
* [33mdf2151a[m Display more user data on /profile PAGE
* [33mbd0873b[m Added EditableDescription COMPONENT
* [33mb998bdd[m Modified ImagesSlider to show a black images placeholder when passed an empty array
* [33m500b51e[m Filters Header LINKS to only show the correct ones depending if you are logged in/out.
* [33m42d48a1[m Added redirect to /profile, /login, /register PAGES if your are / aren't logged in. And the Loading COMPONENT during uncertainty.
* [33m57b677e[m Created Loading COMPONENT.
* [33mfc5d0a4[m Added /register to HEADER
* [33mea50d2d[m Added /register PAGE
* [33mf713317[m Configured Next Auth pages to send you to /login PAGE when having an error during authorization.
* [33meea1f9d[m It turns out that JWT callback isnt for signing in (what a surprise, dont you think). The correct one was the signIn callback. Now I've changed it so this callback returnss true when signed in and false if there was an error on the login process.
* [33m3f64df7[m Updated Next Auth JWT callback to look for a user based on its providerID (first way) or its email/password (second way).
* [33m8b99d59[m Modified /register PGE, now it is /login PAGE. And obviously it only requires email and password. The Custom Provider for Next Auth to handle this CUSTOM login is set. (There only a /register endpoint left to create)
* [33m74571b5[m Configured /profile PAGE to redirect you to /register if you are not logged in. And disabled Apollo Client Cache to avoid false logged in states when removing the user from DB.
* [33m4c9fd7f[m Added lots of ids for the /register PAGE Form, because the Warnings about mismatching between client and server. Should add only the necessary ones...
* [33m17d920a[m Created /profile PAGE
* [33m40d8b12[m Configured buttons for sign up
* [33mfed10e2[m Added getUserByID QUERY, and now we get it on the Next Auth (session) CALLBACK.
* [33me69f6fd[m Modified Next Auth (token) callback to only call a signIn (create/get) operation when the arriving token has not the 'id' property. If it has then just returns the token. If not and if the provider of the data is not our own provider (custom) then it uses registerProvider QUERY.
* [33m5959d0b[m Added NextAuth endpoint to have session control over the App (Setted up Session Provider). Created 2 queries, one for normal register and one for provider register (now only with Github). Fixed Apollo Client (it was pointing 'localhost' instead of 'http://localhost')
* [33mcc2cfb3[m Added Apollo Client to the app. And queries file.
* [33meffa617[m Fixed Image fallback at ImagesSlider, so its the same height as the image.
* [33m6501cf8[m VNavBar when clicked on its links, closes the NavBar
* [33m45b18a1[m Added /register PAGE, wih Formik
* [33m73e2a70[m Moved like and dislike buttons from CardsSlider to Card
* [33m5bca50d[m Added showingUsers CONTEXT, so the transition to the next user is through this context. Modified CardsSlider to behave correctly when receives loading state or dont receive users (it shows an skeleton).
* [33madba5b1[m Added CardsSlider COMPONENT
* [33m8cbf838[m Some ImagesSlider COMPONENNT styling fixes
* [33mb14fc98[m Added ImagesSlider COMPONENT
